# TODO

- add pma to personalised indicators that allow to input the ma model
- add more indicators
  - investopedia has loads of oscillators
  - go through the rest of Welles book https://archive.org/details/newconceptsintec00wild/page/25/mode/2up
- Optional arguments should be indicated. It should be documented whether keyword arguments are part of the interface.
- improve docstrings
- add indicators to correct directories (RSI, SO, MACD should be in momentum?)
- logging
- move docs to sphinx and readthedocs
- check what gets installed in reqs, doubt most of it is needed
- add moving mode, median, MCGin... 
- as well as their envelopes
- rename params to just be price, caller can put whatever price they want in there
- logic in parabolic SAR seems correct but Welles has a way to be funky with his periods and overall logic, so double check from book directly
