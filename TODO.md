# TODO

- tests, tests, tests...
- add pma to personalised indicators that allow to input the ma model
- make period clearer that it is in peaks and pits
- add more indicators (pdf has even more)
  - investopedia has loads of oscilators but probably do pdf first
- Optional arguments should be indicated. It should be documented whether keyword arguments are part of the interface.
- examples in docstrings
- GH actions to run the tests (once they've been built) and maybe package to confirm it works? could even do the upload there
- add indicators to correct folders (RSI SO MACD should be in momentum?)
- logging
- go throuhg the rest of Welles book https://archive.org/details/newconceptsintec00wild/page/25/mode/2up
