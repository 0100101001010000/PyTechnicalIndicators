# TODO

- add pma to personalised indicators that allow to input the ma model
- add more indicators
  - investopedia has loads of oscillators but probably do pdf first
- Optional arguments should be indicated. It should be documented whether keyword arguments are part of the interface.
- examples in docstrings
- add indicators to correct folders (RSI, SO, MACD should be in momentum?)
- logging
- go through the rest of Welles book https://archive.org/details/newconceptsintec00wild/page/25/mode/2up
- do hand calcs for chart_trends.py break_down_trends
- move docs to sphinx and readthedocs
- check what gets installed in reqs, doubt most of it is needed
