# PyTechnicalIndicators

PyTechnicalIndicators is a Python library with a number of common technical indicators used to analyse financial data.

This README will walk you through the Python functions used to calculate various technical indicators and how to call them.
It will not explain what each one is and when or where to use them. If you need more information use Google, Wikipedia,
or Investopedia.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install PyTechnicalIndicators.

```bash
pip install PyTechnicalIndicators
```
---
## Usage

The below is a break down of the various functions in the package, for a detailed example see the [Example](https://github.com/0100101001010000/PyTechnicalIndicators_Examples/tree/main/Notebook_Example).

The library is split into three sections Single, Bulk and Chart_Patterns.

Single and Bulk have identical functions, Single returns a single value, Bulk returns a list. This is to reduce compute
time if you only a single value returned for you series, or to avoid looping a call if you have a lot of data to process.

It is important to note that the functions expect a list of prices to work, with the oldest value at the beginning of the
 list and the most recent price at the end. An indexed Pandas DF will not work, you will have to `list()` before your variables
 you pass it into these functions, the [Example](https://github.com/0100101001010000/PyTechnicalIndicators_Examples/tree/main/Notebook_Example) has more details.

## Single

Single is broken down into 3 sections:

- moving_averages: contains the common moving averages (moving average, exponential ma, smoothed ma, macd),
        as well as a personalised moving average.
- strength_indicators: currently only has Relative Strength Index and Stochastic as well as their personalised variations.
- candle_indicators: currently only has Bollinger Bands and the Ichimoku Cloud as well as their personalised variations.

By personalised variations we mean that we have allowed the user to determine how certain calculations were done.
For example, the RSI uses as smoothed MA to calculate the average gains, the personalised RSI allows you to choose your
MA model. Each personalised function will have more detail on how to use it .

### Moving Averages

Calling moving_averages

```python
from PyTechnicalIndicators.Single import moving_averages
```

#### moving_average(prices)

The simple moving average of a series

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n

__Example:__
```python
prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

ma = moving_averages.moving_average(prices)
```

#### exponential_moving_average(prices)

The exponential moving average (EMA), this is usually used when the latest prices are expected to have a greater impact

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n

__Example:__
```python
prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

ema = moving_averages.exponential_moving_average(prices)
```

#### smoothed_moving_average(prices)

The smoothed moving average (SMA) is similar to the exponential moving average, the calculation of the alpha varies
 slightly (see personalised_moving_average for a more detailed explanation of the alpha)

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n

__Example:__
```python
prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

sma = moving_averages.smoothed_moving_average(prices)
```

#### personalised_moving_average(prices, alpha_nominator, alpha_denominator)

The personalised moving average (PMA) allows you to determine your nominator and denominator values for the alpha.
The alpha determines the impact of previous prices, the higher the alpha the lower past values have an impact. The
calculation is as follows:

```python
alpha = alpha_nominator / (length_prices + alpha_denominator)
```
The alpha_denominator may be a little confusing as it isn't itself the entire denominator, it is a variable that gets
added to the length of the submitted prices to form the actual alpha_denominator.

The EMA used an alpha nominator of 2 and an alpha denominator of 1.
The SMA used an alpha nominator of 1 and an alpha denominator of 0.

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n
- _alpha_nominator:_ float or int, can be 0, but it isn't recommended.
- _alpha_denominator:_ float or int, can be 0

__Example:__
```python
prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

pma = moving_averages.personalised_moving_average(prices, 3, 2)
```

#### moving_average_divergence_convergence(prices)

The moving average divergence convergence (MACD) only returns the MACD line, to get the single line you will need to
call signal_line (detailed below), the histogram is simply one minus the other, and isn't yet provided here.

The moving_average_divergence_convergence **requires** the length of prices to be at least 26 as that is the number of
periods taken into account, it accepts more, but discards the extra no passing them in will only impact your performance.

If you want to pass in a smaller or bigger period see personalised_macd.

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n, must be at least
26 periods in length

__Example:__
```python
prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

macd = moving_averages.moving_average_divergence_convergence(prices)
```

#### signal_line(macd)

The signal line returns the line that is complementary to moving_average_divergence_convergence, and is required
to be 9 periods long, no more, no less. If you'd like to pass in a different amount see personalised_signal_line

__Parameters:__

- _macd:_ list of 9 macds retrieved from moving_average_divergence_convergence

__Example:__
```python
macd = [1.2, 1.45, 0.98 ... ]

signal = moving_averages.signal_line(macd[:-9])
```

#### personalised_macd(prices, short_period, long_period, ma_model='ema')

The personalised macd allows you to determine what the short period and long period are for the macd calculation.
Essentially the macd is the subsctraction of the EMA of the short period - the EMA of the long period, which are
12 and 26 respectively in the traditional MACD. Here we allow you to determine what those periods are.
We also allow you to chose you moving average model in the event where you would prefer something other than the EMA.

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n, the length of prices
must be at least as big as the value for your long_period
- short_period: int, value strictly greater than 0 but smaller than your long_period.
- long_period: int, value strictly greater than the short period but smaller or equal to the length of prices.
- ma_model: _optional_ The moving average model of your choice (defaults to EMA):
  - for moving average either of the following: 'ma', 'moving average', 'moving_average'
  - for smoothed moving average either of the following: 'sma', 'smoothed moving average', 'smoothed_moving_average'
  - for exponential moving average either of the following: 'ema', 'exponential moving average', 'exponential_moving_average'

__Example:__
```python
prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

pers_macd = moving_averages.personalised_macd(prices, 10, 20, 'smoothed moving average')
```

#### personalised_signal_line(macd, ma_model='ema')

The personalised signal line is similar to the personalised MACD in that it lets you decide of the length of the macds
that you want to pass in, however is doesn't require you to insert a variable, it will instead just calculate it based
on the length of the macd list provided.

You can also choose the MA model you would like to run, it is normally just a EMA but you are free to choose your model.personalised

__Parameters:__

- _macd:_ list of macds can be either from a normal macd or a personalised one. The length of the list needs to be greater
than 1 and can be as large as you like.
- _ma_model:_ _optional_ The moving average model of your choice (defaults to EMA):
  - for moving average either of the following: 'ma', 'moving average', 'moving_average'
  - for smoothed moving average either of the following: 'sma', 'smoothed moving average', 'smoothed_moving_average'
  - for exponential moving average either of the following: 'ema', 'exponential moving average', 'exponential_moving_average'

__Example:__
```python
macd = [1.2, 1.45, 0.98 ... ]

signal = moving_averages.personalised_signal_line(macd, 'moving_average')
```

### Strength Indicators

Calling stength indicators

```python
from PyTechnicalIndicators.Single import strength_indicators
```

#### relative_strength_index(prices)

Returns the relative strength index (RSI) of submitted prices, the length of prices needs to be 14 periods long, no more,
no less.

__Parameters:__

```

#### personalised_rsi(prices, ma_model='sma')

The personalised RSI allows you to choose which MA model to use as well as the number of periods. The traditional RSI 
uses 14 periods and a SMA model.

__Parameters__:

- _prices:_ list of floats or int, the length of prices needs to be exactly of length of the period that you want to evaluate.
than 1 and can be as large as you like.
- _ma_model:_ _optional_ The moving average model of your choice (defaults to SMA):

## Bulk

Bulk is broken down into 4 sections, in a very similar way to Single, the only difference is that these are meant to run
against large datasets, and return a **list** of values as opposed to a single point like in Single.

- basic_indicators: These are a list of Python math and statistics functions that have been wrapped up in a loop to allow
  them to return a list. These are mostly to be used within the other functions.
- moving_averages: contains the common moving averages (moving average, exponential ma, smoothed ma, macd),
        as well as a personalised moving average.
- strength_indicators: currently only has Relative Strength Index and Stochastic as well as their personalised variations.
- candle_indicators: currently only has Bollinger Bands and the Ichimoku Cloud as well as their personalised variations.

By personalised variations we mean that we have allowed the user to determine how certain calculations were done.
For example, the RSI uses as smoothed MA to calculate the average gains, the personalised RSI allows you to choose your
MA model. Each personalised function will have more detail on how to use it.

### Basic Indicators

Calling basic_indicators

```python
from PyTechnicalIndicators.Bulk import basic_indicators
```

#### log(prices)

Returns a list of logs for the list of submitted prices. This is just the Python math log function wrapped in a loop to
return a list of logs.

__Parameters:__
- _prices:_ list of floats or ints of prices that needs to be exactly 14 periods long.

__Example:__

```

#### exponential_moving_average(prices, period, fill_empty=False, fill_value=None)

The exponential moving average (EMA), this is usually used when the latest prices are expected to have a greater impact

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n
- _period:_ int, the number of prices that you would like taken into account to calculate the median.
- _fill_empty:_ Boolean, whether you want to fill the list with a value to match the length of the submitted prices. This
  is helpful when using this with Pandas as it will allow to insert the returned list directly into your DataFrame (see
  (Example)[https://github.com/0100101001010000/PyTechnicalIndicators_Examples/tree/main/Notebook_Example] )

 slightly (see personalised_moving_average for a more detailed explanation of the alpha)

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n

__Example:__
```python
prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

sma = moving_averages.smoothed_moving_average(prices, 10, True)
```

#### personalised_moving_average(prices, period, alpha_nominator, alpha_denominator, fill_empty=False, fill_value=None)

The personalised moving average (PMA) allows you to determine your nominator and denominator values for the alpha.
The alpha determines the impact of previous prices, the higher the alpha the lower past values have an impact. The
calculation is as follows:

```python
alpha = alpha_nominator / (length_prices + alpha_denominator)
```
The alpha_denominator may be a little confusing as it isn't itself the entire denominator, it is a variable that gets
added to the length of the submitted prices to form the actual alpha_denominator.

The EMA used an alpha nominator of 2 and an alpha denominator of 1.
The SMA used an alpha nominator of 1 and an alpha denominator of 0.

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n
- _period:_ int, the number of prices that you would like taken into account to calculate the median.
- _alpha_nominator:_ float or int, can be 0, but it isn't recommended.
- _alpha_denominator:_ float or int, can be 0
- _fill_empty:_ Boolean, whether you want to fill the list with a value to match the length of the submitted prices. This
  is helpful when using this with Pandas as it will allow to insert the returned list directly into your DataFrame (see
  (Example)[https://github.com/0100101001010000/PyTechnicalIndicators_Examples/tree/main/Notebook_Example] )
- _fill_value:_ The value that you want used to fill in the empty spaces.

prices = [100, 102, 101 ... ]

pma = moving_averages.personalised_moving_average(prices, 15, 3, 2, True, prices[0])
```

#### moving_average_divergence_convergence(prices)

The moving average divergence convergence (MACD) only returns the MACD line, to get the single line you will need to
call signal_line (detailed below), the histogram is simply one minus the other, and isn't yet provided here.

The moving_average_divergence_convergence **requires** the length of prices to be at least 26 as that is the number of
periods taken into account, it accepts more, but discards the extra no passing them in will only impact your performance.

If you want to pass in a smaller or bigger period see personalised_macd.

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n, must be at least
26 periods in length

```

#### personalised_macd(prices, short_period, long_period, ma_model='ema')

The personalised macd allows you to determine what the short period and long period are for the macd calculation.
Essentially the macd is the subsctraction of the EMA of the short period - the EMA of the long period, which are
12 and 26 respectively in the traditional MACD. Here we allow you to determine what those periods are.
We also allow you to chose you moving average model in the event where you would prefer something other than the EMA.

__Parameters:__

- _prices:_ list of floats or ints with oldest values at position 0 and newest value in position n, the length of prices
must be at least as big as the value for your long_period

that you want to pass in, however is doesn't require you to insert a variable, it will instead just calculate it based
on the length of the macd list provided.

You can also choose the MA model you would like to run, it is normally just a EMA but you are free to choose your model.personalised

__Parameters:__

- _macd:_ list of macds can be either from a normal macd or a personalised one. The length of the list needs to be greater
than 1 and can be as large as you like.

__Parameters:__
- _typical_prices:_ 
- _min_period:_ _optional_ number of periods either side of the evaluated price to determine a pit or peak
